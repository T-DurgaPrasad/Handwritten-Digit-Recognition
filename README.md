# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition
● This model will classify the given handwritten image, used MNIST data for model training.
● Placed 4 layers, convolution layers with 16 filters and kernal size 3, and used MaxPooling with window size and one Flatten layer and one Dense layer with 64 units.
● Used Dense layer with softmax activation and 10 units for classification 
● Used Adam Optimizer to achieve an accuracy of (98 - 99)%.
